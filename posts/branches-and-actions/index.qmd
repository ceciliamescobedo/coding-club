## Introduction

In this post we will learn all about github flow, making branches, and adding actions.

In today's tutorial, we will create a new branch for the coding-club website. We will create a blog entry post in this branch and demonstrate how to merge it with the main branch using a pull request to ensure that our blog post appears on the website.

But first, let's define some concepts!

## Defining Basic Concepts

### **Branches**

A *branch* is a parallel version of a repository.

It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "primary" version. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. When you've made changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch (using pull request) to publish your changes and make it available for other users.

This feature can be specially useful in collaborative projects. For example, imagine you're working on a project with a team, and you want to add a new feature to the code. Instead of making changes directly to the primary version, you can create a new branch and make changes there. This means you can experiment and work on the feature without affecting the primary version. Branching also allows allows one or several people to work on different parts of the code at the same time without interfering with each others work or without creating conflicting files.

In Git, branching is considered a lightweight process, meaning it's quick and easy to create a new branch and switch between branches.

### **Pull request**

*Pull requests* are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's owner/collaborators.

### **Github Action**

A *github action* is a clean environment that is located in a server and can run code from beginning to end. GitHub Actions is a platform that allows you to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline. It allows you also to run any arbitrary code on your repository when a specific event happens on a Github repository. A github action can be breakdown into several components:

-   *Events.* An event is anything that can happen on a github repository.An event can be anything from pushing a code, creating a branch or building a complete website.
-   *Workflow*. A workflow is an automated process composed of a series of jobs that gets executed when it's triggered by an event. Workflows are defined in YAML files and are stored in the `github/workflows directory` at the root of the repository.
-   *Jobs*. A job is a series of tasks that gets executed in a workflow upon being triggered by an event
-   *Runners*. Runners are processes on a server that run the workflow when it's triggered.
-   *Actions*. Actions are individual tasks that are called inside a job. Actions are used to perform complex tasks that you may call multiple times and import into your workflows.

For more information regarding github actions please visit: [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

### **Github Flow**

Github flow is a branch-based workflow that is useful for collaborating in projects. Github flow usually involves the following steps:

1.  Creating a new branch
2.  Making changes and adding the commits
3.  Creating a pull request
4.  Reviewing changes and accepting them
5.  Merging your pull request
6.  Deleting your branch

For more information regarding github flow please visit: [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

![Github Flow.](images/Github-flow.png){#fig-Github-flow align="center"}

## Prerequisites

### **usethis Setup**

`usethis` is an R package that offers support for package development and Github workflows. It automates repetitive tasks that arise during a project setup and development. You can install it by typing `install.packages("usethis")` in your R Studio console.

`usethis` package will be specially helpful for its pull request helpers that will be shown in more detail down below.

For more information regarding these package please visit: [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html)

### **Create a temporary token**

A Github personal access token (PAT) is required to use *usethis functions* that create something in github such as, a pull request. To get a personal access token type the following into your console:

```{r}
usethis::create_github_token()
```

If you're signed into GitHub, `usethis::create_github_token` takes to a pre-filled form to make a new PAT. Once there, describe the token's purpose in the *Note* field, and change the expiration day to 7 days. Afterwards click *Generate token* at the bottom of the page. Note that you can also generate a temporary token directly in the Github page: [Github Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

![Generating a temporary token.](images/temporary-token.png){#fig-Generating-a-temporary-token align="center" width="80%" height="90%"}

Once the token is generated, you will get a long string of characters (green section) as you can observe in @fig-Copying-the-temporary-token. Copy this token into your clipboard.

![Copying the temporary token.](images/temporary-token-2.png){#fig-Copying-the-temporary-token align="center" width="80%" height="90%"}

Go back to R studio and type the following in the console `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

``` {{r}}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

This will prompt yout to enter your token, so just paste it!

Note: If you already have a stored credential, `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` reveals this and will even let you inspect it. This helps you decide whether to keep the existing credential or replace it. In my case I choose the option that said "Replace this credentials."

## Forking and cloning

A *fork* can be defined as a personal copy of a repository in GitHub owned by a different user.

A *Clone* is defined as a local version of a repository, including commits and branches. A clone is basically a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere. When you make a clone, you can edit the files and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.

Then, first step is to fork the source repository (in this case the website repository), to get our own copy on GitHub, and then clone that, to get our own local copy. To do this type the following in the R Studio console:

``` {{r}}
usethis::create_from_github("rostools/coding-club", fork = true))
```

What this does is that - It forks the coding-club repository owned by rostools (Luke) into my Github account - Clones the coding-club repository into a folder named "coding-club" in my desktop - *origin remote* is set to my coding-club repository (personal copy). - Opens a new instance of RStudio in the coding-club project, if I'm working in RStudio. Otherwise, switches your current R session to that project. Does additional Git setup: - *upstream* remote is set to the coding-club repository owned by rostools(original one). - *master branch* is set to track upstream/master, so you can pull upstream changes in the future.

In case the line above gives you an error, you can go to the following link where the cloning repository is located. In this case it was: <https://github.com/ceciliamescobedo/coding-club>.In the page:

-   Click the *code* button and copy paste the URL link under the HTTPS tab. See @fig-Cloning-directly-from-Github.
-   Go back to R Studio. Click file \> new project \> version control\> Git\> paste the URL\> click create new project.
-   In the console type `gert::gert_remote_add ("https://github.com/rostools/coding-club.git", “upstream”)`. This will set the rostools/coding-club (orginal repo) as the upstream.

## Creating a new branch and making changes.

`pr_init()`creates a branch in our repository. Go to your R console and type:

``` {{r}}
usethis::pr_init("add-action")
```

This will create a branch called `add-action` and we switch to it.

Now we will be able to work locally, making changes to files and commiting them to Git. We will use this branch to create a Github action that will build up our coding-club website.

If you want to see the list of branches, go back to your R console and type:

``` {{r}}
gert::git_branch_list()
```

After hitting enter you will be able to see the list of branches as shown in @fig-List-of-branches.

The important branches are the ones that does not include *origin* or *upstream* in their name. In this case we have two branches that meet those requirements -\> *main* which was the original branch and *add-action* which is the branch we created. 

![List of branches](images/list-branches.png){#fig-List-of-branches align="center" width="80%" height="90%"}

## Using Github Actions

So now, let's go ahead set up the infrastructure to create a website using Github actions.

There are several actions that you can directly copy-paste from Google.

In our case we searched for "*quarto dev actions.*"

Click on the first link (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions) and go inside the folder named "examples." Inside that folder open the `.yml` file named `quarto-publish-example.yml`.Click on the raw button and copy the URL on your clipboard (see @fig-Copying-an-action-using-raw-button)

![Copying an action using raw button](images/quarto-dev-action.png){#fig-Copying-an-action-using-raw-button align="center" width="90%" height="90%"}

Go back to R Studio. Use the `usethis::use_github_action` and paste the URL.

``` {{r}}
usethis::use_github_action("build-website", url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/main/examples/quarto-publish-example.yml")
```

This line of code will create a new folder called `.github`, that can be access through the file pane in Rstudio.

-   Open the `.github` this folder. Go to the `workflow` folder and open the `quarto-render-publish.yml` file.
-   In the section named *Set up Quarto* change to `tynitex:false`
-   Un-comment the section that is named *Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)* and delete the sections named *Publish to Netlify* and *Publish to RStudio Connect* (lines 22-38)
-   Click save
-   Go to the Git pane (`ctrl+alt+m`), stage everything in the git folder and commit changes.

This steps will generate the website, push it to github and build the website in Github.

## Creating a pull request

Since we are done with the changes we wanted to make in our branch, we are ready to push our branch called `add-action`

``` {{r}}
 usethis::pr_push()
#Note: Select the 'origin' option when the line prompts it.
```

`pr_push()` pushes the local changes we have made (specifically the branch `add.action`) to my copy of coding-club on GitHub (*origin remote*) and puts me in position to make your pull request.

This launches a browser window with the Github page, which looks like @fig-Creating-a-pull-request.

- Click the *create pull request* button

Notice that in @fig-Creating-a-pull-request at top it says `rostools/coding-club` not `Cecilia/coding-club.` 

![Creating a pull request](images/pull-request.png){#fig-Creating-a-pull-request align="center" width="80%" height="90%"} 

### Review of pull request, merge and finish. 

The owner of the repository will accept the changes. This will merge it into the coding-club repository and we can start generating the website through that. 

![Merging a branch](images/merged-branch.png){#fig-Merging-a-branch align="center" width="80%" height="90%"}

Once this is done we can use `usethis::pr_pause()`. This switches you from the branch called `add-action` to the branch called `main.`

## Practice: Using the Github workflow to create a blog post in the website

In summary the Github flow involves the following:

1.   Creating a branch

2.  Making changes

3.  Creating a pull request

4.   Reviewing pull request

5.   Merging and finish

So now let's go ahead and create a blog post using this steps.

1.   Create a new branch using `usethis::pr_init("post-branches)`

2.  In this case the change will be creating a blog post.

-    Go to file-\> New File-\> Quarto Document

-   Save this file in a new location. For this got to File -\> Save as -\> Coding-club -\> posts -\> Create new folder -\> Call it `branches-actions`

-   Open the Quarto Document and saved it as `index.qmd`. Important: for all blog posts the Quarto document should always be named `index.qmd` and the folder where it is stored should be the post title. - Copy the YAML from an old blog post and modify the post.

-   Go to the Git pane and commit changes.

3.  Create a pull request.

-   Go to you console and type `usethis::pr_push()` and select option 1 to push to the `origin remote`.

-   Click the pull request button on the github window that opened.

4.   Wait for the pull request to be reviewed.

5.  Merging will occur if changes are accepted. To finish with the pull request, type `usethis::pr_finish()`. This line of code will close your branch. Note in case you want to resume your branch you can type `usethis::pr_resume` instead.
